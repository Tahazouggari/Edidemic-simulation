 * @brief This file contains the functions and structures for the simulation
 * viewer.
 *
 * The simulation viewer allows users to interact with the simulation of a
 * pandemic. It displays the current state of the simulation in a graphical
 * interface and updates it in real-time. The viewer is implemented using GTK
 * and provides various features such as a simulation board, an information
 * board, and a newspaper area that shows the latest news of the simulation.
 * This file contains the declaration of the structures and functions used in
 * the simulation viewer. These include the Application structure, which holds
 * the GTK widgets and the simulation data, and the functions to initialize and
 * start the viewer, update the window, and handle user events.
